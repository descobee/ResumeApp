# Derek's Resume App

This is a simple one-screen flutter application built to display basic UI features. 

## Codebase Description
The codebase for this application just consists of 2 classes. The main.dart class and the homepage.dart file. All UI, methods and variables were declared on the homepage.dart file - to make the app as minimalistic as possible.

## Design Description
The design is a very simple design that implemted only four colours - white, two different shades of blueish gray and a dark blue background colour. The application itself is a dark mode application, hence the reason for the design template selected.

## Libraries Used
There are only 3 libraries used by the application:
- flutter_svg: To implement the addition of SVG icons.
- launch_url: Used in launching the links embedded in the application.
- expandable: Used in implementing some smooth container transistions.

## Features Wish-List
If I had more time, I would have implemented toggling the application theme between dark and light mode. I also would have made the application a multi-screen application for each resume segment. Something else I considered implementing was to make the profile image to be a slideshow of different images. These and a few others were considered.
